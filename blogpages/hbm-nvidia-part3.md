## Part 3 - From Theory to Practice: HBM in GEMM Workloads

In the previous part of this series, we explored the architectural characteristics and performance behavior of HBM in NVIDIA GPUs. While that discussion provided a solid theoretical and empirical understanding of HBM performance, this part will focus on a practical application. Specifically, we will examine how HBM performs in one of the most prevalent and critical operations in modern machine learning: GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication).
