Welcome to this multi-part blog series exploring the details and performance of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) as employed in NVIDIA GPUs. This is a technical deep dive, starting from the fundamentals of NVIDIA GPU memory architectures and progressing to an analysis of how modern AI and ML applications leverage HBM for optimal performance. Whether you're a newcomer curious about GPU memory, an experienced professional optimizing HBM performance, or a visionary architect designing next-generation systems, you'll find valuable insights here. The content aims to address:

* Optimizing current workloads to enhance HBM performance.

* Developing new HBM or memory architectures for future products.

* Understanding HBM performance on NVIDIA GPUs to design and architect your own systems effectively.

The blog is divided into four parts, with Part 1 serving as the foundation. Based on your expertise and familiarity with the topics, feel free to either start from the beginning or navigate directly to the sections most relevant to you.

I hope you find this series insightful and engaging! Your feedback and comments are always welcome.
